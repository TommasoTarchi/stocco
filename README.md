# stocco

This is **stocco**, final project for the exam Stochastic Modelling and Simulation, part of the MSc in Data Science and Scientific Computing 
at Uiversity of Trieste/SISSA. The aim is that of reproducing the simulations results exposed in [this paper](Zhu-Efficient_simul_population_model_carcinogenesis.pdf) and (possibly) extend them.


## What you will find in this repository

- This README file
- `Zhu-Efficient_simul_population_model_carcinogenesis.pdf`: paper used as basis for the project

  - `stocco_lib.py`: library containing all functions used for the simulations
  - `fixed_population.py`: script used for fixed-population simulations
  -
